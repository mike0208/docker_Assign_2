# docker_Assign_2
This repository contains the files for the docker Assignment 2

In mike0802/docker_ass_hello_world:latest - used the httpd image rather than using apache2 image because apache2 changed the configuration of installation process and requires additional steps such as geographical location which can't be given directly through Dockerfile and it stops the terminal

docker-compose.yaml -> to bind the volume and dynamically can give the index.html at runtime from the data_dir docker_swarm_commands.txt file -> all the commands to do the 2nd part of the assignment
